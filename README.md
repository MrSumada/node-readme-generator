## CONTRIBUTIONS

Our goal is to get clearly communicated README's for as many projects as possible. You can contribute by making this the new normal!

## TESTS

After running node index, create a fake project utilizing each parameter. This will help familiarize yourself with the flow of the program, and shouldn't take too much of your time.
